		<h1>The Ulam Spiral</h1>
		<p>Lets face it, primes are some of the most fascinating numbers out there. In 1963 a mathematician by the name Stanislaw Ulam 
			was very bored at a scientific meeting and doodling in his notebook, he noticed that starting from the center with 1 and 
			working counter clockwise out writing the next number along the edges of squares, primes had a strong tendency to appear 
			on diagonals. You can read more about it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral">wikipedia</a>, but here is a 
			Ulam Spiral, the black dots are primes, red is the center. <strong>Be careful</strong> with max primes, at the max (500000) it can crash some computers.
